# Signals for Services

Inspired by concepts and techniques in signaling theory, stigmergy, systems thinking, semiotics, and
social cognition, OpenSignals offers a humane and scalable way to infer and reason about the state
of systems of services. OpenSignals provides a simplified model and superior means to reframe and
contextualize data collected that is meaningful, relevant, and effective for application monitoring
and service management.
